### Greetings!üëã

I am Aleks Mashanski, a Documentation Developer, who also interested in Machine Learning, Kaggle contributing and Artificial Intelligence.

A lot of my repositories & pet projects represented here, from my school days when I tried Java and C languages to nowadays, where mostly of my projects are related with Python and Data Science in general.
I'm in relations with high math since my secondary school. And I really like the fact that things like mathematics, combinatorics, statistics & probability theory can be combined with programming and generate an interesting result!

In addition, I‚Äôm interested in the mathematical aspects of cryptography, various cryptographyc algorithms & methods. As well as the application of cryptographic techniques to other fields, such as Data Science.
