### Greetings!👋

I am Alex Maszanski, a Data Scientist who interested in Machine Learning, Kaggle contributing and Artificial Intelligence. I'm a writer on [proglib.io](https://proglib.io) website. Most of my articles focus on the realm of Data science, especially Machine Learning methods & algorithms.


A lot of my repositories & pet projects represented here, from my school days when I tried Java and C languages to nowadays, where mostly of my projects are related with Python and Data Science in general.
Also I'm in relations with high math since my secondary school. And I really like the fact that things like mathematics, combinatorics, statistics & probability theory can be combined with programming and generate an interesting result!
