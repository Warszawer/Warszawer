### Greetings!👋

I am Alex Maszanski, a Data Scientist who interested in Machine Learning, Kaggle contributing and Artificial Intelligence. I'm a writer on [proglib.io](https://proglib.io) website. Most of my articles focus on the realm of Data science, especially Machine Learning methods & algorithms.


A lot of my repositories & pet projects represented here, from my school days when I tried Java and C languages to nowadays, where mostly of my projects are related with Python and Data Science in general.
Also I'm in relations with high math since my secondary school. And I really like the fact that things like mathematics, combinatorics, statistics & probability theory can be combined with programming and generate an interesting result!

- Machine Learning Algorithms: Linear Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting(Xgboost, Catboost, LightAutoML)
- Industry Knowledge: Feature Engineering, Data preparation, Time Series Analysis, PCA
- Tools and Technologies: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, LightAutoML, Vowpal Wabbit, Git 
- Soft Skills: Educability, Time Management, Self-motivation, Communication
- Languages: English, Polish, Russian
